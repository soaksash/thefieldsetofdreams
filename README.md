Contains demo materials for dreamforce demo "Building Dynamic and Configurable Visualforce pages using fieldsets.". This is a free for use for template for creating fieldset-oriented pages within salesforce.

Demo materials are free for distribution and free for use within project implementations as long as materials are not repackaged for commercial use as a package. Pay it forward. Coolio?
